# I am: Rock, Paper, Scissors . . .

## Overview

This project is a **Multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors** game with a unique twist. Inspired by the scene *"The Oldest Game"* from Netflix's *The Sandman* ([watch here](https://youtu.be/iZOwaeAEIw0?si=jdPaKsYxEO3JqHz7)), the traditional "rock, paper, scissors" mechanics are replaced with custom prompt submissions. You decide what person, place, thing or concept will face off against your opponent, limited only by your imagination. 

Players submit any prompt, and **ChatGPT** evaluates the submissions to decide the winner based on its interpretation of each player's move. Additionally, the game is visually enhanced through a custom **Google search engine integration**, which fetches relevant images corresponding to the submitted prompts.

The project was built using the **MEVN** stack (**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **V**ue, and **N**ode.js).
